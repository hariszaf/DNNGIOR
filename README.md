# A novel way to gapfill metabolic models

## Installation instructions

To run the `dnngior` gapfiller, the [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) solver is required (mandatory).

```
pip install gurobipy
```

To use `gurobi`, you need a [license](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/). If you are an acedemic, you may get a license for free.

Once you have successfully installed `gurobi`, you are ready to install the `dnngior` gapfiller.

```
pip install dnngior
```

## How to use

You may find examples of gapfilling a genome scale reconstruction (GEM) with `dnngior` with a complete or a defined medium in this [example notebook](https://github.com/hariszaf/DNNGIOR/blob/notebook/tutorials/example.ipynb).
